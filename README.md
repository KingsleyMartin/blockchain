# blockchain

A toy implementation of a blockchain in Clojure based on ["Learn Blockchains by Building One"](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

## Usage

This code has no practical use, since I only wrote it as an exercise to learn more about blockchains and practice writing [specs](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) for functions during development.

I wrote about the experience [here](https://gist.github.com/bhb/1d315481199ca6573dfcd24282b98ce5)

If you want to run the tests, run `lein test`
